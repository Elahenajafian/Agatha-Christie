    <p id="first">
      <strong>Agatha Mary Clarissa Miller</strong> was born on 15 September 1890
      in Torquay, Devon, South West England into a comfortably well off middle
      class family. What made her upbringing unusual, even for its time, was
      that she was home schooled largely by her father, an American. Her mother,
      Clara, who was an excellent storyteller, did not want her to learn to read
      until she was eight but Agatha, bored and as the only child at home (she
      was a much loved “afterthought” with two older siblings) taught herself to
      read by the age of five.

      Captain Arthur Hastings's first description of Poirot: He was hardly more
      than five feet four inches but carried himself with great dignity. His
      head was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little on
      one side. His moustache was very stiff and military. Even if everything on
      his face was covered, the tips of moustache and the pink-tipped nose would
      be visible. The neatness of his attire was almost incredible; I believe a
      speck of dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet
      this quaint dandified little man who, I was sorry to see, now limped
      badly, had been in his time one of the most celebrated members of the
      Belgian police.
