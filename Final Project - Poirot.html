              <strong>Agatha Mary Clarissa Miller</strong> was born on 15
              September 1890 in Torquay, Devon, South West England into a
              comfortably well off middle class family. What made her upbringing
              unusual, even for its time, was that she was home schooled largely
              by her father, an American. Her mother, Clara, who was an
              excellent storyteller, did not want her to learn to read until she
              was eight but Agatha, bored and as the only child at home (she was
              a much loved “afterthought” with two older siblings) taught
              herself to read by the age of five.

          Captain Arthur Hastings's first description of Poirot: He was hardly
          more than five feet four inches but carried himself with great
          dignity. His head was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always
          perched it a little on one side. His moustache was very stiff and
          military. Even if everything on his face was covered, the tips of
          moustache and the pink-tipped nose would be visible. The neatness of
          his attire was almost incredible; I believe a speck of dust would have
          caused him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandified
          little man who, I was sorry to see, now limped badly, had been in his
          time one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police.
